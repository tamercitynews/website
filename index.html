    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Let me introduce myself, I'm a frontend developer with a strong sense of graphic communication.</p>
    <p>I like building interfaces, structuring a design system, extracting concepts, minimizing code, learning new techniques and comparing myself.<p>
    <p>One of the aspects that I'm most passionate about in my work are the micro interactions. I focus on the times and feelings that animations should arouse in users.<p>
    <p>Of my work I like that I can compare myself with the designers to think together about the reworking of the conventions, so as not to have to repeat ourselves every time!<p>
